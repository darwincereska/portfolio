**ttymer**, was one of my first projects made in [Go](https://go.dev).

#### Why I made it.
I made ttymer as a response to finding that the only other available CLI timer application was outdated and lacked essential features.
My goal was to take initiative and build a modern, user-friendly timer app with a clean interface and better functionality.

#### The result.
The result is an aesthetically pleasing CLI tool that provides a great timer experience in the terminal.
