### I’m starting a YouTube Channel!

Hey everyone, I am starting a YouTube channel called **Darwin Does Stuff.** 

It basically is a channel about me figuring out different coding things, or other tech related stuff.

It’s a way to teach myself and the viewer more skills.

### Does this effect the blog?

**Yes**! When I post a video on YouTube, I am going to link a text form version of the video here on this blog. It will include:

- Images
- Detailed guides
- My thoughts
- Pros & Cons
- Tips & Tricks
- Links to documentation
- Any other things related to the video

### When will videos release?

I plan on making higher quality content once I get a better laptop, visit my [Ko-fi](https://ko-fi.com/darwincereska) to help support me, and help extra funding for a MacBook.
